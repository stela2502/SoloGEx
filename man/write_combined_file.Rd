\title{Write combined SoloGEx results to a file}
\usage{
write_combined_file(singleton, file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{singleton}{A \code{SoloGEx} object with \code{singleton_analysis} slot filled.
Expression data should be in \code{@expr}, sample metadata in \code{@colData}.}

\item{file}{Character string specifying the file path to write the table.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{write.table()}, e.g.,
\code{sep = ","}, \code{quote = FALSE}, \code{col.names = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The results are written to the specified file.
}
\description{
Exports the combined results from a \code{SoloGEx} object to a file.
This includes expression values, reference group statistics, and singleton
analysis results. The function is a wrapper around \code{export_combined()}
and standard \code{write.table()}.
}
\details{
Before writing, the function checks that the \code{singleton_analysis} slot exists.
If missing, it stops with an informative error. The resulting file contains:
\itemize{
  \item Expression values for each gene and sample
  \item Group statistics (mean, SD, CV) if available
  \item Singleton analysis results (Z-scores, closest group, overall deviation)
}
}
\examples{
# Assume 'single_edat' has singleton analysis computed
write_combined_file(single_edat, "singleton_results.csv", sep = ",", quote = FALSE)

}
